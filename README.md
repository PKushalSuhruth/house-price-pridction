# House Price Prediction

A Python-based project that predicts house prices using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms to estimate the price of a house.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Predicts the price of a house based on input features.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes algorithms like Linear Regression to build the prediction model.
- **Data Visualization**: Offers visual insights into the relationships between features and house prices.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the prediction script:
    ```bash
    python predict_house_price.py
    ```

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Flask (if deploying as a web app)

## How to Use
- Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
- Run the script to train the model and make predictions.
- Visualize the results to understand the influence of different features on house prices.
